description = "This project was completed in a team of 4. We used R and Python to manipulate the data which we pulled from Seattle's own data repository. Once the data was in a usable manner, we used Tableau for the cool visualization found on the page. The R statistical tests and logistical regression were not included in this site, as they were for our classroom environment only."
