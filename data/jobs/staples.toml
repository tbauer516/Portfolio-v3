description = "As an Easy Tech Associate, I was tasked with coming into work to an army of sick and broken computers that I needed to crank though in my measly 5-hour shifts. Specifically, I had to talk to customers bringing in their computers for repair, figure out what it was they were actually meaning when they described their problem, recommend a solution, and provide rationale as to why my solution was correct while translating it into terms that most people can relate to. After they left their computer, I had to juggle my time between sitting behind my counter and fixing said computer, walking around the floor helping people find things, recommending certain laptops and printers for people's needs, finding crazy back-assward solutions to people's unique problems, and running up to the front to backup cashier. One thing I took away from working at Staples was the skills to communicate to people. I learned very quickly how to communicate with people of all calibers when talking about technology."
