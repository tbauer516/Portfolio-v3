description = "At Mobilize.net, I was in charge of our teams software development project (of which there were three total). I coached, taught and organized how the software was to be writted. The project was to rewrite a VB6 desktop application to an ASP.net web application that could be accessed from anywhere or any device. With the new feature of accessing important software to interact with clients from something such as a smart phone, our application rewrite increased work efficiency. The other part of the job included researching the true cost of rewriting an application versus using Mobilize.net's tools to simply have them do it for you versus simply maintaining an old legacy application. The research findings provided the Mobilize.net team with better tools to help their customers make better decisions."
