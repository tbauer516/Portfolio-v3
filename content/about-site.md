	"Hello there! My name is Tyler Bauer and I am a senior at the University of Washington studying Informatics. In case you do not know what Informatics is, here is a quick overview: Informatics is the midpoint between Computer Science, User Design and User Experience, and Business. I have the pleasure of learning about development skills including Java, Web Development and even Android. I also have the opportunity to develop my ability to design for a wide range of users and the specific needs that they have. I also have the skills to work in dispersed and non-dispersed teams to achieve project goals, as well as analyse and operate business processes along the way. My focus at the university has left me with a wide range of skills and abilities that I cannot wait to put to good use in industry.",
	"Below you will find a grid with some of the projects I have worked on, beginning with this very website that you are viewing. I designed and wrote up the code for the website myself (with the help from some libraries).",
	"Please enjoy your stay here with me, and feel free to reach out and connect with me below.",
	"Tyler Bauer"
