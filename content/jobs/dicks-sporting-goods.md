description = "At Dick's Sporting Goods, I was tasked with being the go-to guy when anyone needed information or work done on: bikes, tennis rackets, exercise equipment and any team sport. I had to run two departments in opposite corners of the store by myself. I also had to cover the hunting and fishing department when needed, as well as run a backup cash register if they were swamped. If there is one thing that I can say that I learned from this job, it is that I know how to hold my own when the going gets tough, and I can always expect to come out on top."
