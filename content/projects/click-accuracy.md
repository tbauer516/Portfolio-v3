title = "Click Accuracy"
description = "This was a project I created for my Research Methods course, as it can gauge the accuracy of using a pointing device. It was intended to be used by several different people on the same computer, as the test is dependent on resolution and screen size. It uses an HTML canvas element that records clicks and stores the data in a Firebase Array that can be later retrieved for analysis."
